# This hook example shows running a command inside a shell. As a result, features such as variable
# interpolation are available. This shows the TRUNK_STAGING_DIR environment variable, one of a set
# of default variables that Trunk inserts into your hook's environment. Additionally, this hook
# uses the build stage, meaning it executes in parallel with all of the existing asset pipelines.
